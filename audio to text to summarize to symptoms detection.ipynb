        "      Hello, how can I help you today? Hi, Doctor. I've been feeling very tired lately, and I seem to be getting hair make more frequently. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms? The tiredness has been going on for a few weeks, but the hair make started just a few days ago. Have you noticed any other symptoms, like changes in appetite or sleep patterns? Yes, actually. I've been having trouble sleeping, and I haven't been very hungry. I see. Have you been under a lot on stress recently? At work or home? Yes, work has been very stressful lately. It's possible that stress could be contributing to your symptoms. Have you tried any methods to reduce your stress, like exercise or relaxation techniques? I've tried, but I haven't been very consistent. I recommend trying to incorporate regular exercise and mindfulness practices into your routine. Additionally, let's run some blood tests to rule out any other possible causes. That sounds like a good plan. Thank you, Doctor. You're welcome. We'll schedule the tests, and follow up once we have the results. In the meantime, try to take it easy, and focus on self-care. I will. Thank you.\n",

I’d like to run some tests to check your blood work and see if there’s an underlying medical condition. It might also be helpful to discuss your mental health further, as sometimes physical symptoms can be linked to stress or anxiety.\n",
